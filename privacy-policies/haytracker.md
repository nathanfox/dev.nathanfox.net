# Privacy Policy for HayTracker

**Last Updated:** December 15, 2025

## Introduction

HayTracker ("the App") is a hay and straw inventory tracking application developed by Nathan Fox ("we", "our", or "us"). This privacy policy explains how the App handles your information.

## Summary

**HayTracker does not collect, transmit, or share any of your data.** All information you enter stays on your device.

## Information Collection and Use

### What Data the App Uses

HayTracker allows you to enter and store:
- Hay and straw inventory entries
- Bale types and descriptions
- Quantity and bale counts
- Notes

### How Data is Stored

All data is stored **locally on your device only**. This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to any servers
- Is not accessible to us or any third parties
- Is not backed up to our servers

### Data We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect:
- Personal identification information
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Usage analytics
- Crash reports
- Any other telemetry

## Third-Party Services

HayTracker does not integrate with or transmit data to any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not have access to your data. Your information exists solely on your device.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on your device's security settings. We recommend:
- Using a device passcode or biometric lock
- Keeping your device's operating system updated
- Being cautious about who has physical access to your device

## Data Retention and Deletion

Your data remains on your device until you choose to delete it. You can:
- Delete individual entries within the App
- Uninstall the App to remove all associated data

We have no ability to access, retain, or delete your data as it exists only on your device.

## Children's Privacy

HayTracker does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age. The App does not collect personal information from any users.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

Since HayTracker does not collect any data, there is no way for us to notify you directly of policy changes. Significant changes will be noted in the App's update notes on the App Store and Google Play Store.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect or store any of your personal data, traditional data subject rights (access, correction, deletion, portability) are not applicable in the conventional sense. You have complete control over your data on your device.
